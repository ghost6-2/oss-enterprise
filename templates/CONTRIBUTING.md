Contribution Guidelines

Hello üëã!

freeCodeCamp.org is possible, thanks to thousands of kind volunteers like you. We are grateful for your contributions and we are excited to welcome you aboard.

We strictly enforce our "Code of Conduct". Take a moment to read it. It's only 196 words long.

Happy contributing üéâ!
Here are some fun ways that you can help

You can choose to contribute to any area that interests you:

    Contribute to this open source codebase. Help to edit guide articles, coding challenges, or fix bugs on the learning platform.

    Help campers on our public forum. Answer their coding questions or give them feedback on their coding projects.

    Help us add subtitles or closed captions to our YouTube channel videos.

Contribute to this open source codebase

We have a huge open source codebase consisting of thousands of coding challenges and guide articles.

You can help us to:

    üìù Research, Write and Update our guide articles

    üíª Create, Update and Fix Bugs in our coding challenges

    üåê Translate guide articles

    üõ† Fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform

Research, Write and Update our guide articles

What are guide articles?

Guide articles help you get a quick understanding of a technology concept. These are short, plain English explanations that you can read before going on to more in-depth resources.

You can find an example article about HTML Anchor Elements here.

What can I write an article about?

We welcome your help in writing these articles. You don't have to be an expert on a topic to write about it. This entire Guide is open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.

To help, find a stub article on our Guide website, write the article, then open a pull request to replace the stub with your article. A pull request is how you'll suggest changes. It lets others know about, review, and eventually adopt your changes.

If you can't find a stub about the topic you'd like to write about, you can open a PR that creates the stub and includes your draft article.

If you would like to help improve guide articles, here's how to work on guide articles.
Create, Update and Fix Bugs in our coding challenges

All our coding challenges are curated by the community, bringing in expert knowledge from volunteers like you.

You can help expand them and make their wording clearer. You can update the user stories to explain the concept better and even remove redundant ones. You can also improve the challenge tests to make them more accurately test people's code.

If you're interested in improving these coding challenges, here's how to work on coding challenges.
Translate guide articles

You can help us translate our Guide articles for a language that you speak. Currently, we have translated versions in:

    Arabic (ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä)
    Chinese (‰∏≠Êñá)
    Portuguese (Portugu√™s)
    Russian (—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π)
    Spanish (Espa√±ol)

We would love your help in improving the quality of these translations. Millions of people use the English language version of freeCodeCamp.org, and we expect millions more to use these translated versions as well.

Note that once we have finished Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum we plan to translate it as well.
Help us fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools, and libraries, including but not limited to, Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

    We have a Node.js based API server.
    A set of React based client applications.
    A script that we use to evaluate our front-end projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax, and a lot of curiosity.

Essentially, we expect basic familiarity with some of the aforementioned technologies, tools, and libraries. With that being said, you are not required to be an expert on them in order to contribute.

If you want to help us improve our codebase, here's how to setup freeCodeCamp locally.

Feel free to ask us questions on the related issue threads, and we will be glad to clarify. When in doubt, you can reach out to our platform dev team to help you with this:

Frequently Asked Questions

How can I report a bug that is not on board?

If you think you've found a bug, first read the "Help I've Found a Bug" article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so that we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note that any issues that seek coding help on a challenge will be closed. The issue tracker is strictly for codebase related issues and discussions. Whenever in doubt, you should seek assistance on the forum before making a report.

How can I report a security issue?

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to security@freecodecamp.org and we'll look into it immediately.

I am stuck on something that is not included in this documentation. How can I get help?

Feel free to ask for help in:

    The "Contributors" category of our public forum
    Our public contributors chat room on Gitter

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. Make sure you search for your query before posting a new one. Be polite and patient. Our community of volunteers and moderators are always around to guide you through your queries.

I am new to GitHub and Open Source in general:

Read our How to Contribute to Open Source Guide.

What do these different labels that are tagged on issues mean?

Our community moderators triage issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity, and other factors. You can find a complete glossary of their meanings here.

You should go through help wanted or first-timers welcome issues for a quick overview of what is available for you to work on. These are up for grabs, and you do not need to seek permission before working on them.

If these issues lack clarity on what needs to be done, feel free to ask questions in the comments.

I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspects of the curriculum.
